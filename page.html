<li>A camera is an optical instrument that captures images. Most cameras can capture 2D images, while some more advanced models can capture 3D images.</li>
<li>At a basic level, most cameras consist of a sealed box (the camera body), with a small hole (the aperture) that allows light to pass through and capture an image on a light-sensitive surface (usually a digital sensor or photographic film).</li>
<li>Cameras have various mechanisms to control how light falls onto the light-sensitive surface, including lenses that focus the light and a shutter that determines the amount of time the photosensitive surface is exposed to the light.</li>
